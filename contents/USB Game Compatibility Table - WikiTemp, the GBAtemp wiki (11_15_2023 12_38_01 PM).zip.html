Game Compatibility Table for USB/SD Loading
Anyone is free to edit this list though you must create an account first. Vandals will be banned and their IP blocked from further edits.

Game Troubleshooting: PLEASE READ BEFORE EDITING
Make sure your USB device works and is stable before reporting games that don't work. See USB Devices Compatibility List
Make sure your USB device isn't overheating due to long usage when reporting crashes.
Make sure you don't just have a bad dump (bad game copy). If it's a game others have given a green light, that is a strong possibility. Throw away the game iso and reload from an uncorrupted source.
Other USB devices, especially USB LAN adapter, might interfere with the loader. When testing, unplug the LAN adapter and delete the "Wired Connection" profile if the wifi-enabled game freezes.
If your game uses USB peripheral game controllers (guitars, mics, etc.) check out the Rock Guide
Some games seem to require a disc (any game) in the drive to work. When testing, first try without any disc in the drive. If it only works with a disc in the drive, add that in the Notes column.
Think you need the Anti-002 fix? You probably don't.
For more troubleshooting information, read WiiPower's Compatibility Guide.
IOS Base and EmuNAND
Most games should work with a cIOS using either base56 or base57, but very few games might require one specific base, sometime neither 56 nor 57.
If a game is not compatible, you might want to verify if it requires any specific IOS Base first.
If a game is not compatible, try different IOS bases, and if base56 or base57 don't work then update the IOS Base compatibility list too.
Some disc based games might not work if emuNAND is enabled. Be sure to disable emuNAND option from your loader when testing a game.
Posting Guidelines: PLEASE READ BEFORE EDITING
Please mention what loader and version you are using in the "notes" section if you are having an issue.
If a game is working it doesn't always make it green, as titles marked green should be/are 99.9-100% compatible. See color chart below.
The Notes section is only for quirks regarding the way the game plays with the loader. Notes like 'Works Great' are not needed and simply add clutter.
Regarding regions, please don't take an existing entry and completely change the region - start a new entry, or add it ALONG with the existing region.
Extended Information to be placed at the bottom of the page, only for games that are marked as not working for most people, but working for some. only people who have it working should post info.
If you are the first person to add a game then the confirmed column should read 0 (as it is unconfirmed). Every person should then add 1 to that when they have tested it as working and change the confirmation date.

Compatibility Legend

Class (?)

Games that work 100% or have few/very minor issues, like stuttering audio, or other things that don't affect gameplay.

ct-works

Games that work almost 100% and are playable but have some issues like missing textures or crashes after doing certain in-game action not supposed to be done (a intentional bug for example).

ct-minor

Games that mostly work but with more serious but playable bugs, or random lockups (random doesn't mean lock up every time at the same spot in the game).

ct-issues

Games that do not load and have major problems and/or are unplayable, or have consistent lock ups.

ct-broken

Unknown status. Game has not been tested, or the test results were unclear.

ct-noresult

To add an entry, copy and paste the following into a new line

{{USB Game Compatibility Table/Table Entry | Name= | Result= | Region= | GameID= | Size= | Notes= | Confirmed= | Date= }}

Use {{!}} instead of | to seperate your notes from previous edits | Confirmed=+1 | Date=Todays Date. Must be in the form of 5 ~'s ie: ~~~~~.

Use 1.1 or above(1.0 has a bug with the time). Works 100% on 1.1 or higher. If your HDD goes to sleep, dialogs and such will take a while to load since it has to wake it back up. Will occasionally get "data is corrupted on all usb loaders". Just restart console and it'll be fine. Turn WiiConect24 OFF if you get freezes. / WiiConect24 works with old IOS36 rev9. Works 100% with WiiConnect24 on using CoverFloader (No Freezes whatsoever), and with rev14. USB Keyboards work with a cIOS with base 38

[edit] neogamma beta 44 with ios 257 makes it work past Jada.

note 1) Use WiiFlow to avoid the 8 mission freeze.note 2) Use ConfigUSB r49 with region fix on. 002 Fix for certain cases to avoid the 8 mission freeze.note 3) Not a single USB loader worked for me, I'm sorry. What finally did work was burning the ISO on a Verbatim DVD-R disk at 2x-speed. I loaded this with "NeoGamma R8". Then in the game, just after the nuke, just as the next level starts loading eject the disk. Then put the disk back in and press A repeatedly until you see things are back on track.note 4) Another player- I ran MW reflex from a 640Gb WD passport (newer one with troublesome virtual CD removed) using CFGloader on a 4.1 PAL Wii and everything is groovy, finished the game and online multiplayer is cool too. Honestly, lucky me :)

Run the game normally, select a Mii and create a save profile, then exit. Individual games are then playable using alt.dol methods - rs5mp1_p.dol=Metroid Prime 1, rs5mp2_p.dol=Metroid Prime 2 and rs5mp3_p.dol=Metroid Prime 3. cIOS38 rev 14 doesn't require a disk in the drive to play the games but as dual layer support is broken Hermes cIOS222 or similar must be used to play Metroid Prime 3 with "any disk" in the drive. There's no way to choose the save slot, difficulty or play Metroid Prime 2 Multi-player using alt.dol methods. UPDATE: Use the cIOS rev21d2x6 with base 56 and Neogamma, CFG, or USB Loader GX. Select the new "Block IOS Reload" option (or set it to auto for USB loader GX) and it works on a WBFS formatted drive (and NTFS drive with USB Loader GX).

Configurable USB Loader v.49 - select 1 for option and select use alternative *.doll. Extract Partition 1 (DATA)/redsteel.dol from the ISO with WiiScrubber, copy to SD:/games/REDP41.dol and use uLoader 2.1C; In my case, redsteel.dol was located in "PARTITION:[[2]] - DATA". Extracted it with "WiiScrubber 1.31 Final", renamed it to "REDP41.dol", transfered it to "SD:/dol-alt" (path to alternate dols can be set in the «global settings» of the USB Launcher GX). After that, loaded USB Loader GX, went into Red Steel's «settings» and under "Alternate DOL" changed to "ON". Now game works! Im on Softmod/USB Launcher GX rev571/CIOS 13b some people may get a minor bug which is that all the graphics in some places go either completly black or a weird blue colour. just reboot and it should be fine;

Use alt.dol method if you haven't already with Wii Sports Resort. For example, if you are loading a backup from USB Loader GX, here's what you would do: 1) Select the option called "load settings" from USB Loader's "Red Steel 2" configuration menu, 2) Scroll down to the "dol" section, and change it from "default" to the .dol file contained in the ISO (this may be called something like "player.dol"), save your settings and exit out of the mini configuration menu, 3) Start the game. After a moment you should see an introduction screen introducing you to the Wii Plus device, press the A button to start the video (NOTE: you can either watch the video in its entirety, or exit out mid way through viewing it, as long as the Wii has detected the video has ran at least once, you should be fine), 4) Restart USB Loader GX and change the .dol setting back to "default" within the Red Steel 2 mini-configuration menu, 5) save your settings, exit the menu and proceed to play the game. (These steps apply to both PAL and NTSC regions)

Rock Guide USB peripherals need work around: Install Hermes cIOS 223, 37 merge 36. Run Loader from 222 and launch game from 223 (in game settings). Plug peripherals in top port and USB drive in bottom port. USB hub can be used in top port. Tested with USBLoaderGXr571 on cIOS 222 38merge36, game settings cIOS 223 37merge36. Game sometimes freezes on black when launching. Older fix: How to get the mic (and possibly the other USB instruments also) to work: Plug in the mic, start the game with only one Wiimote on (must be free of any instrument), the game will recognize the Mic! If you want to play in a band, just activate the wiimotes with instruments after the mic gets recognized by the game. Have fun! - Gives a black screen when booting on a PAL Wii 3.2E; works on PAL Wii 4.0E. Works fine with loader 1.5 and GHWT instruments on WII 4.0U DLC DOES WORK ON SD CARD
